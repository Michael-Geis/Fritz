While each of these models has\\nbeen extensively studied, not so much is known about the connection between\\nthem. In the recent paper (arXiv:2303.10620), assuming the linear form of the\\npressure, the Authors connected two multi-phase models by an inviscid limit:\\nthe viscoelastic one (of Brinkman's type) and the inviscid one (of Darcy's\\ntype). Here, we prove that the same is true for a nonlinear, power-law\\npressure. The new ingredient is that we use relation between the pressure $p$\\nand the Brinkman potential $W$ to deduce compactness in space of $p$ from the\\ncompactness in space of $W$.</td>\n",

By a more direct\\napproach without using the super poly-harmonic properties of nonnegative\\nsolutions, we establish an integral representation for nonnegative solutions to\\nthe above higher order fractional equations whether the singularity $\\{0\\}$ is\\nremovable or not. As the first application, we prove Liouville theorems for\\nnonnegative solutions to the above equations with removable singularity for all\\n$\\sigma \\in (0, n/2)$ when $$ 1 &lt; p &lt; p_{\\sigma,\\alpha}^*:=\\frac{n+2\\sigma\\n-2\\alpha}{n-2\\sigma}~~~ and ~~~ -\\infty &lt; \\alpha &lt; 2\\sigma. $$ This, in\\nparticular, covers a gap occurring for non-integral $\\sigma \\in (1, n/2)$ and\\n$\\alpha \\in (0, 2\\sigma)$ in the current literature. As the second application,\\nwe show the radial symmetry of nonnegative solutions to the above equations in\\nthe critical case or in the case where the singularity at the origin is not\\nremovable.

       "      <td>We consider some iterative methods for finding the best interpolation data in\\nthe images compression with noise. The interpolation data consists of the set\\nof pixels and their grey/color values. The aim in the iterative approach is to\\nallow the change of the data dynamically during the inpainting process for a\\nreconstruction of the image that includes the enhancement and denoising\\neffects. The governing PDE model of this approach is a fully parabolic problem\\nwhere the set of stored pixels is time dependent. We consider the semi-discrete\\ndynamical system associated to the model which gives rise to an iterative\\nmethod where the stored data are modified during the iterations for best\\noutcomes. Finding the compression sets follows from a shape-based analysis\\nwithin the $\\Gamma$-convergence tools, in particular well suited topological\\nasymptotic and a ``fat pixels'' approach are considered to obtain an analytic\\ncharacterization of the optimal sets in the sense of shape optimization theory.\\nWe perform the analysis and derive several iterative algorithms that we\\nimplement and compare to obtain the most efficient strategies of compression\\nand inpainting for noisy images. Some numerical computations are presented to\\nconfirm the theoretical findings. Finally, we propose a modified model that\\nallows the inpainting data to change with the iteration and compare the\\nresulting new method to the ``probabilistic'' ones from the state-of-the-art.</td>\n",

       "0     Several recent papers have addressed modelling of the tissue growth by the\\nmulti-phase models where the velocity is related to the pressure by one of the\\nphysical laws (Stoke's, Brinkman's or Darcy's). While each of these models has\\nbeen extensively studied, not so much is known about the connection between\\nthem. In the recent paper (arXiv:2303.10620), assuming the linear form of the\\npressure, the Authors connected two multi-phase models by an inviscid limit:\\nthe viscoelastic one (of Brinkman's type) and the inviscid one (of Darcy's\\ntype). Here, we prove that the same is true for a nonlinear, power-law\\npressure. The new ingredient is that we use relation between the pressure $p$\\nand the Brinkman potential $W$ to deduce compactness in space of $p$ from the\\ncompactness in space of $W$.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

One central ingredient in the argument was a new\\ndefinition of quasinormal modes, where a non-standard choice of stationary\\nKilling vector field had to be used in order for the Fredholm theory to be\\napplicable. In this paper, we show that there is in fact a variety of allowed\\nchoices of stationary Killing vector fields. In particular, the horizon Killing\\nvector fields work for the analysis, in which case one of the corresponding\\nergoregions is completely removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

For the Navier-Stokes-BGK system, we\\nestablish the existence and uniqueness of solutions in Sobolev spaces with\\nexponential weight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "4998  We consider some iterative methods for finding the best interpolation data in\\nthe images compression with noise. The interpolation data consists of the set\\nof pixels and their grey/color values. The aim in the iterative approach is to\\nallow the change of the data dynamically during the inpainting process for a\\nreconstruction of the image that includes the enhancement and denoising\\neffects. The governing PDE model of this approach is a fully parabolic problem\\nwhere the set of stored pixels is time dependent. We consider the semi-discrete\\ndynamical system associated to the model which gives rise to an iterative\\nmethod where the stored data are modified during the iterations for best\\noutcomes. Finding the compression sets follows from a shape-based analysis\\nwithin the $\\Gamma$-convergence tools, in particular well suited topological\\nasymptotic and a ``fat pixels'' approach are considered to obtain an analytic\\ncharacterization of the optimal sets in the sense of shape optimization theory.\\nWe perform the analysis and derive several iterative algorithms that we\\nimplement and compare to obtain the most efficient strategies of compression\\nand inpainting for noisy images. Some numerical computations are presented to\\nconfirm the theoretical findings. Finally, we propose a modified model that\\nallows the inpainting data to change with the iteration and compare the\\nresulting new method to the ``probabilistic'' ones from the state-of-the-art.   \n",
       "4999  In this paper, we study the energy critical 1-equivariant Landau-Lifschitz\\nflow mapping $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{S}^2$ with arbitrary given coefficients\\n$\\rho_1\\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\rho_2>0$. We prove that there exists a codimension\\none smooth well-localized set of initial data arbitrarily close to the ground\\nstate which generates type-II finite-time blowup solutions, and give a precise\\ndescription of the corresponding singularity formation. In our proof, both the\\nSchr\\\"odinger part and the heat part play important roles in the construction\\nof approximate solutions and the mixed energy/Morawetz functional. However, the\\nblowup rate is independent of the coefficients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "      <td>Motivated by some recent potential theoretic results on subordinate killed Levy processes in open subsets of the Euclidean space, we study processes in an open set LATEX  defined via Dirichlet forms with jump kernels of the form LATEX  and critical killing functions. Here LATEX  is the Levy density of an isotropic stable process (or more generally, a pure jump isotropic unimodal Levy process) in LATEX  The main novelty is that the term LATEX  tends to 0 when LATEX  or LATEX  approach the boundary of LATEX  Under some general assumptions on LATEX  we construct the corresponding process and prove that non-negative harmonic functions of the process satisfy the Harnack inequality and Carleson's estimate. We give several examples of boundary terms satisfying those assumptions. The examples depend on four parameters, LATEX  LATEX  roughly governing the decay of the boundary term near the boundary of LATEX    In the second part of this paper, we specialise to the case of the half-space LATEX  the LATEX  kernel LATEX  and the killing function$appa(x)=c x_d^{-\\alpha}$, LATEX  where LATEX  is a positive constant. Our main result in this part is a boundary Harnack principle which says that, for any LATEX  there are values of the parameters LATEX  LATEX  and the constant LATEX  such that non-negative harmonic functions of the process must decay at the rate LATEX  if they vanish near a portion of the boundary. We further show that there are values of the parameters LATEX  LATEX  for which the boundary Harnack principle fails despite the fact that Carleson's estimate is valid.</td>\n",

Representing a given pattern as a smooth, stable invariant manifold of the deterministic dynamics, we reduce the stochastic dynamics to a finite dimensional SDE on this manifold using the isochronal phase. The isochronal phase is defined by mapping a neighbourbhood of the manifold onto the manifold itself, analogous to the isochronal phase defined for finite-dimensional oscillators by A.T.~Winfree and J.~Guckenheimer. We then determine a probability measure that indicates the average position of the stochastic perturbation of the pattern/wave as it wanders over the manifold. It is proved that this probability measure is accurate on time-scales greater than LATEX  but less than LATEX  where LATEX  is the amplitude of the stochastic perturbation. Moreover, using this measure, we determine the expected velocity of the difference between the deterministic and stochastic motion on the manifold.</td>\n",

Here, we focus on mechanical models of growing plant tissues, where microscopic (sub)cellular structure is taken into account. In order to establish links between microscopic and macroscopic tissue properties, we perform a multiscale analysis of a model of growing plant tissue with subcellular resolution. We use homogenization to rigorously derive the corresponding macroscopic tissue scale model. Tissue scale mechanical properties are computed from all microscopic structural and material properties, taking into account deformation by the growth field. We then consider case studies and numerically compare the detailed microscopic model and the tissue-scale model, both implemented using finite element method. We find that the macroscopic model can be used to efficiently make predictions about several configurations of interest. Our work will help making links between microscopic measurements and macroscopic observations in growing tissues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We prove an almost global in time existence result of small amplitude space periodic solutions of the 1D gravity-capillary water waves equations with constant vorticity. The result holds for any value of gravity, vorticity and depth and any surface tension belonging to a full measure set. The proof demands a Hamiltonian paradifferential Birkhoff normal form reduction for quasi-linear PDEs in presence of resonant wave interactions: the normal form may be not integrable but it preserves the Sobolev norms thanks to its Hamiltonian nature. A major difficulty is that usual paradifferential calculus used to prove local well posedness (as the celebrated Alinhac good unknown) does not preserve the Hamiltonian structure. A major novelty of this paper is to develop an algorithmic perturbative procedure a la Darboux to correct usual paradifferential transformations to symplectic maps, up to an arbitrary degree of homogeneity. The symplectic correctors turn out to be smoothing perturbations of the identity, and therefore only slightly modify the paradifferential structure of the equations. The Darboux procedure which recovers the nonlinear Hamiltonian structure is written in an abstract functional setting, in order to be applicable also in other contexts.</td>\n",

As a direct application, we prove the uniqueness for a related inverse source problem on determining the temporal component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "3812  Motivated by some recent potential theoretic results on subordinate killed Levy processes in open subsets of the Euclidean space, we study processes in an open set LATEX  defined via Dirichlet forms with jump kernels of the form LATEX  and critical killing functions. Here LATEX  is the Levy density of an isotropic stable process (or more generally, a pure jump isotropic unimodal Levy process) in LATEX  The main novelty is that the term LATEX  tends to 0 when LATEX  or LATEX  approach the boundary of LATEX  Under some general assumptions on LATEX  we construct the corresponding process and prove that non-negative harmonic functions of the process satisfy the Harnack inequality and Carleson's estimate. We give several examples of boundary terms satisfying those assumptions. The examples depend on four parameters, LATEX  LATEX  roughly governing the decay of the boundary term near the boundary of LATEX    In the second part of this paper, we specialise to the case of the half-space LATEX  the LATEX  kernel LATEX  and the killing function$appa(x)=c x_d^{-\\alpha}$, LATEX  where LATEX  is a positive constant. Our main result in this part is a boundary Harnack principle which says that, for any LATEX  there are values of the parameters LATEX  LATEX  and the constant LATEX  such that non-negative harmonic functions of the process must decay at the rate LATEX  if they vanish near a portion of the boundary. We further show that there are values of the parameters LATEX  LATEX  for which the boundary Harnack principle fails despite the fact that Carleson's estimate is valid.   \n",
       "3040  We consider and provide an accurate study for the fractional Zernike functions on the punctured unit disc, generalizing the classical Zernike polynomials and their associated LATEX  Zernike functions. Mainly, we give the spectral realization of the latter ones and show that they are orthogonal LATEX  for certain perturbed magnetic (hyperbolic) Laplacian. The algebraic and analytic properties for the fractional Zernike functions to be established include the connection to special functions, their zeros, their orthogonality property, as well as the differential equations, recurrence, and operational formulas they satisfy. Integral representations are also obtained. Their regularity as poly-meromorphic functions is discussed and their generating functions including a bilinear one of \"Hardy--Hille type\" are derived. Moreover, we prove that a truncated subclass defines a complete orthogonal system in the underlying Hilbert space giving rise to a specific Hilbertian orthogonal decomposition in terms of a second class of generalized Bergman spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "4377  We study the dynamics of waves, oscillations, and other spatio-temporal patterns in stochastic evolution systems, including SPDE and stochastic integral equations. Representing a given pattern as a smooth, stable invariant manifold of the deterministic dynamics, we reduce the stochastic dynamics to a finite dimensional SDE on this manifold using the isochronal phase. The isochronal phase is defined by mapping a neighbourbhood of the manifold onto the manifold itself, analogous to the isochronal phase defined for finite-dimensional oscillators by A.T.~Winfree and J.~Guckenheimer. We then determine a probability measure that indicates the average position of the stochastic perturbation of the pattern/wave as it wanders over the manifold. It is proved that this probability measure is accurate on time-scales greater than LATEX  but less than LATEX  where LATEX  is the amplitude of the stochastic perturbation. Moreover, using this measure, we determine the expected velocity of the difference between the deterministic and stochastic motion on the manifold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "2527  How morphogenesis depends on cell properties is an active direction of research. Here, we focus on mechanical models of growing plant tissues, where microscopic (sub)cellular structure is taken into account. In order to establish links between microscopic and macroscopic tissue properties, we perform a multiscale analysis of a model of growing plant tissue with subcellular resolution. We use homogenization to rigorously derive the corresponding macroscopic tissue scale model. Tissue scale mechanical properties are computed from all microscopic structural and material properties, taking into account deformation by the growth field. We then consider case studies and numerically compare the detailed microscopic model and the tissue-scale model, both implemented using finite element method. We find that the macroscopic model can be used to efficiently make predictions about several configurations of interest. Our work will help making links between microscopic measurements and macroscopic observations in growing tissues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

In contrast to Yudovich's energy method, we employ a Lagrangian strategy to show uniqueness.   Our entire argument relies on elementary real-variable techniques, with no use of either Sobolev spaces, Calderon-Zygmund theory or Littlewood-Paley decomposition, and actually applies not only to the Biot-Savart law, but also to more general operators whose kernels obey some natural structural assumptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "3471  We prove an almost global in time existence result of small amplitude space periodic solutions of the 1D gravity-capillary water waves equations with constant vorticity. The result holds for any value of gravity, vorticity and depth and any surface tension belonging to a full measure set. The proof demands a Hamiltonian paradifferential Birkhoff normal form reduction for quasi-linear PDEs in presence of resonant wave interactions: the normal form may be not integrable but it preserves the Sobolev norms thanks to its Hamiltonian nature. A major difficulty is that usual paradifferential calculus used to prove local well posedness (as the celebrated Alinhac good unknown) does not preserve the Hamiltonian structure. A major novelty of this paper is to develop an algorithmic perturbative procedure a la Darboux to correct usual paradifferential transformations to symplectic maps, up to an arbitrary degree of homogeneity. The symplectic correctors turn out to be smoothing perturbations of the identity, and therefore only slightly modify the paradifferential structure of the equations. The Darboux procedure which recovers the nonlinear Hamiltonian structure is written in an abstract functional setting, in order to be applicable also in other contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

For LATEX  LATEX  with LATEX  one sees an enhanced dissipation effect wherein the characteristic decay time-scale is accelerated to LATEX  where LATEX  is the singularity of the kernel ($s=1$ being the Landau collision operator, which is also included in our analysis); for LATEX  one sees Taylor dispersion, wherein the decay is accelerated to LATEX  Additionally, we prove almost-uniform phase mixing estimates.

Furthermore, we obtain Lorentz-Sobolev estimates for solutions to the obstacle problem and other important applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

The Lieb functional was actually shown by Lieb to be a convexification of the so-called Levy-Lieb functional. Given an electronic density for a system of LATEX  electrons, which may be seen as a probability density on LATEX  the value of the Lieb functional for this density is defined as the solution of a quantum multi-marginal optimal transport problem, which reads as a minimization problem defined on the set of trace-class operators acting on the space of electronic wave-functions that are anti-symmetric LATEX  functions of LATEX  with partial trace equal to the prescribed electronic density. We introduce a relaxation of this quantum optimal transport problem where the full partial trace constraint is replaced by a finite number of moment constraints on the partial trace of the set of operators. We show that, under mild assumptions on the electronic density, there exist sparse minimizers to the resulting moment constrained approximation of the Lieb (MCAL) functional that read as operators with rank at most equal to the number of moment constraints. We also prove under appropriate assumptions on the set of moment functions that the value of the MCAL functional converges to the value of the exact Lieb functional as the number of moments go to infinity. We also prove some rates of convergence on the associated approximation of the ground state energy. We finally study the mathematical properties of the associated dual problem.</td>\n",

One central ingredient in the argument was a new definition of quasinormal modes, where a non-standard choice of stationary Killing vector field had to be used in order for the Fredholm theory to be applicable. In this paper, we show that there is in fact a variety of allowed choices of stationary Killing vector fields. In particular, the horizon Killing vector fields work for the analysis, in which case one of the corresponding ergoregions is completely removed.</td>\n",

Given an electronic density for a system of LATEX  electrons, which may be seen as a probability density on LATEX  the value of the Lieb functional for this density is defined as the solution of a quantum multi-marginal optimal transport problem, which reads as a minimization problem defined on the set of trace-class operators acting on the space of electronic wave-functions that are anti-symmetric LATEX  functions of LATEX  with partial trace equal to the prescribed electronic density. We introduce a relaxation of this quantum optimal transport problem where the full partial trace constraint is replaced by a finite number of moment constraints on the partial trace of the set of operators. We show that, under mild assumptions on the electronic density, there exist sparse minimizers to the resulting moment constrained approximation of the Lieb (MCAL) functional that read as operators with rank at most equal to the number of moment constraints. We also prove under appropriate assumptions on the set of moment functions that the value of the MCAL functional converges to the value of the exact Lieb functional as the number of moments go to infinity. We also prove some rates of convergence on the associated approximation of the ground state energy. We finally study the mathematical properties of the associated dual problem.   \n",
       "3  In a recent paper, we proved that solutions to linear wave equations in a subextremal Kerr-de Sitter spacetime have asymptotic expansions in quasinormal modes up to a decay order given by the normally hyperbolic trapping, extending the existing results. One central ingredient in the argument was a new definition of quasinormal modes, where a non-standard choice of stationary Killing vector field had to be used in order for the Fredholm theory to be applicable. In this paper, we show that there is in fact a variety of allowed choices of stationary Killing vector fields. In particular, the horizon Killing vector fields work for the analysis, in which case one of the corresponding ergoregions is completely removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
